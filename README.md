This is small React Blog using the MERN stack to test its features.

For the backend I am using Node.js and Express to handle API calls. Database selection for this project is MongoDB with mongoose to handle scheemas and models. Frontend is handled fully on React, using react functional components and hooks to handle state. 

The application allows to post and read data at the moment, future features will implement other characteristics that display the capabilities of React.

This project is intended to test and learn about the full MERN stack.
